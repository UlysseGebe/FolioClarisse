# PORTFOLIO 

## Instructions 

This portfolio has a main page, with the menu and a rotating effect to showcase the different projects. The user can click to discover each project, that click will lead him to a page dedicated to the work, with an option to discover the next project or return to the project index in the footer. Some projects have links to their respective websites, when those projects have them online.
When the user clicks on the about page, it leads him back to the personal introduction and invites him to scroll down to see the projects.
With more time, we will create a canvas interactive animation as a loader for the portfolio to captivate the audience while the website loads.
